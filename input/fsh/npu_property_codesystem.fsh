    Note 1: The system can be a patient (e.g. body of a patient), a distinct part of the patient (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid), or a part of the patientâ€™s surroundings (e.g., house dust or drinking water).
    Note 2: The system is an in vivo system that occurs in the patient. Hence, sample or specimen is an in vitro system that occurs outside the patient and is an artifact. E.g. serum does not occur in the patient but is an artifact created when coagulation of the collected sample is processed."""
* #unit "Unit" """Real scalar quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which any other quantity of the same kind can be compared to express the ratio of the two quantities as a number"""
